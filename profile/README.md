# A note from the Joy_ team

Joy_ was born from a simple truth: giving should feel good — for both the giver and the receiver. Too often, gifts turn into guesswork. Wrong size, wrong color, something they didn’t really need. We wanted to change that.

With Joy, the act of giving becomes effortless, yet meaningful. You choose the gesture, and the person you care about gets the freedom to choose what truly makes them happy. It’s about cutting through the clutter and bringing gifting back to what matters: connection, thoughtfulness, and joy.

We believe the best gifts aren’t about things, but about the feeling they create. That’s why Joy exists — to make every gift personal, simple, and full of possibilities.

With gratitude,

Franz, Titus and the Joy_ team
